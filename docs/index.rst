mlir-graphblas Documentation
============================

mlir-graphblas is an implementation of `GraphBLAS <http://graphblas.org>`_ using `MLIR <https://mlir.llvm.org/>`_.
The goal is to use MLIR's compiler optimizations to perform delayed fusion and achieve good performance with
a relatively simple and understandable implementation of the required API functions.

mlir-graphblas also includes several tools to assist in writing MLIR code.
